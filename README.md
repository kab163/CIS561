# CIS561
Included:

    HW0scanner.c
    executable file
    input.txt

How to Run:

- Compile with "gcc HW0scanner.c -o scanner". Then run with "./scanner input.txt". The program will take the input file and parse it.

What HW0scanner.c Does:

- Still trying to figure this out. Uses Flex somehow?

Special notes:

- input.txt contains several lines of input, each line will be individually processed. 
- HW0scanner.c only looks for single and double quotes as well as commas (googled the HTML tags in description of HW0 and thats what they translated to).
